                <li>1 cup sugar (divided)</li>
                <li>6 tbsp dark rum</li>
                <li>1.5 cups marscapone cheese (cold)</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream (cold)</li>
                <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
                <li>1 tbsp instant espresso powder</li>
                <li>1 (7 oz) package ladyfinger</li>
                <li>unsweetened cocoa powder to dust on top (not Dutch processed)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p> <h2 class="title_two">Steps</h2>
            <ol class="text steps">
                <li>Lightly oil an 8x8 baking dish</li>
                <li>Set a large heatproof bowl over the boiling pot of water to create a double broiler (bowl is over the pot)</li>
                <li>Whisk eggs and 3/4 cups of sugar into the bowl until sugar is dissolved</li>
                <li>Gradually whisk 4 tbsp of rum into the bowl and transition to whisking rapidly for 10 minutes until the mixture of thick, foamy, and very pale yellow</li>
                <li>Remove bowl from the heat to cool down until room temperature</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, use and hand or stand whisk for the marscapone and cream until the mixture holds firm</li>
                <li>Fold 1/3 of the marscapone-cream mixture into the other mixture and gently whisk, then add the remaining 2/3 in</li>
                <li>In a wide, shallow dish, whisk the remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the remaining 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) of rum, the boiling water, and the espresso powder. Stir to dissolve the sugar and espresso.</li>
                <li>Assemble the tiramisu. Dunk one ladyfinger at a time in the espresso liquid, turning it so that all sides are evenly moistened â€” a quick dunk is all you need; any more and the ladyfingers start to disintegrate. Arrange the dunked ladyfingers in rows on the bottom of the baking dish.
                Once you finish the layer, spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Repeat dunking and arranging a second layer, and spread the remaining mascarpone over top.</li>
                <li>Chill the tiramisu by covering it and refrigerating for 8-24 hours to let it firm up and let the ladyfingers soften</li>
                <li>Dust top with cocoa before serving</li>
            </ol>
